## Banana navigation project

This repository provides way to train Deep Reinforcement 
Learning agent in order to collect Bananas in virtual environment.

In order to run this code, you'll need Unity Environment that 
Udacity team provided in Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree. 


### Training 

For training, see file `train_agent.py`

### Running

I committed one trained file in models/ folder that you can use 
to run this code without training. Just run:
```
python run_agent.py --env_file your/path/Banana.app --model_file models/best_model.pth
```

### Pipeline 

Whole pipeline is available in notebook Navigation.ipynb
